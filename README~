#### Steps for running Garfiled++ @ ACCRE

1. Login to ACCRE account
2. Load the following modules as per the commands below
 $ module load GCC/6.4.0-2.28                                                                                                                             $ module load OpenMPI/2.1.1                                                                                                                              $ module load Pango/.1.41.0                                                                                                                              $ module load garfieldpp/2017.2-Python-2.7.14  
3. Check whether the modules are loaded by issuing the following command
 $ module list
4. Save the above modules by a name of your choice as per the command below
 $ module save <module_name>
Note : Replace <module_name> by name of your choice
5. Open your login file (for example .bashrc file) and add the following line 
 module restore <module_name>
6. Logout of ACCRE account and relogin and check whether modules are loaded properly or not by issuing command as in step 3. 
7. Go to either singlegem or triplegem directory. Compile either of the code by issuing following command
 $make
8. If the compilation is successful then one will get executable "single_gem" for "singlegem" code or "triple_gem" for "triplegem" code.
9. For running interactively just issue the following commands
  $ ./single_gem 1    [For single gem inside singlegem folder]
  $ ./triple_gem 1    [For triple gem inside triplegem folder]

One will get output ROOT file within OUTFILE folder 

10. For running slurm job do the following
Single gem example : $ cd singlegem/submission
                     $ ../single
